During these days we are very used to hear the word "Collaboration". In our communication we always tend to hear that our meeting can be scheduled with so and so collaborative software, so and so collaborative platform. Collaboration is becoming the essence of communication and project work when people are situated at different location.

Naturally once in a life we come across the situation when we have used so and so collaborative platform. The main goal is to share the idea and get the result with the support of everyone. Share the success with collaborative work and make the life easy.

We may have also noticed that there are few situations when we raise our voice against a problem and say that we do not have enough compete for it. Take an another example that we have some idea in our mind and we want to make it alive anyhow, but at the same time ego is not allowing to share ideas with others.

This is the point where we need to understand the power of collaboration. With the help of collaboration, our idea can be shared across the globe and different people from the globe can contribute and make it live. There is no need to stick with ego when the idea is powerful and it just needs a few few helping hands.

For sure, all the time our nature does not behave same. It may require developing such attitude and understanding for sharing things. 

To create a path breaking career, one needs open up their mind and collaborate on an idea.

Happy collaboration and happy new year!!
