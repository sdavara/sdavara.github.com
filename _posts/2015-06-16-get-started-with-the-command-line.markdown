Many of us have hated command line and loved the GUI tools. There is not an issue of loving GUI tools and get work done. Personally, I was  the guy, who preferred to complete work with the help of GUI tools as I've worked for 5+ years on the windows platform. Before a couple of years back, I shifted my focus to work on the opensource platform and so my OS changed to mac. 

I've found below resources that may help to shift to the command line or get started with the command line.

[CONQUERING THE COMMAND LINE - An online book](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/)

[Command line power user - A video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7tXPJp5ZmUpuT7sFvrswzf)

[Learn the Command line - An online course by codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)


There are plenty of resources, if you search on the web. 

Happy programming!!
