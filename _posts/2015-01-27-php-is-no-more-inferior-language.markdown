I remember the time, when I was used to hate PHP and looking at PHP language as an inferior language. In addition, I have seen PHP developers feeling a great inferior quality in their life.

I have not imagined anytime to work in php language, but with the touch of [laravel](http://laravel.com), I became fan of the framework and ultimately PHP commmunity.

I could sense from the past and current experience that people could write bad and good code. That's the reason of deciding PHP as an inferior language. Earlier version of PHP might have bad practice and bad framework, but recent development in the community and language seems very promising.

There is a rise of TDD, DDD and other patterns pushes the language and the whole community to grow with time. Certainly, people of community are warm and ready to help out and share their knowledge of building robust application.

New tools and technology also forces us to follow better coding practices. Now, we can say PHP is no more inferior language.
