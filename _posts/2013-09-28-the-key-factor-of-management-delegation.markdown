It has been always said in an organization, \'get the job done anyhow\' it does not necessarily how, but it must be done.

Delegation is the very important factor in effective result of any organization. More people work more output can be produced it’s the rule of any manufacturing. If one person is doing the job right with required quality, he can’t produce a large quantity. It’s required that he should delegate his responsibility and in turn produce large number.

Delegation does not mean just passing work and get it done, but it includes passing the vision. Good manager has ability to delegate nicely and get it done better than he could have done it.

There are different types of delegation technique.

#### First is the old rigid one, pass the Order ####
This is a very traditional technique for delegation. In this method, a higher authority gives order to lower authority ,'get this job done, give me result, do this anyhow, bla bla..'This is very old fashioned delegation technique, it does not work well at all the time.

#### Second, take your share in the result #####
In this technique, the delegation empowers person to work willingly. A person should feel to do work for his growth, he/she should take his responsibility. He/She should be motivated in taking initiate. The manager does not need to involve in how doing it. The manager does not play a role of executing task but he is helping hand when it requires. A person is master of himself, he is ordered by his desires to get the job done

In any organization it’s very important to delegate responsibility at the right time and right way. It is very much required to grow.

It’s simply that 1 * 1 = 1 and 1 * 10 = 10. Here, common 1 is the good manager who can delegate and produce good results by delegating to more and better people.

Best of luck :)
